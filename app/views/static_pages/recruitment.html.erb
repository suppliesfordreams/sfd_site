        <p class="p-large pt-4">We see a world where the opportunity to learn and achieve is not determined by a person’s neighborhood or class, but by that individual’s passion and persistence for learning. We operate programs that provide Chicago Public Schools students with basic resources and extracurricular opportunities. And we'd like your help.</p>

            <p>Academic Enrichment oversees Supplies for Dreams’ mentoring program in our CPS partner schools. Through mentoring sessions, we strive to help students develop their confidence, agency, love of learning, and broad worldview. At the Headquarters level, the AE team develops and edits the curriculum used across all SFD chapters. We regularly revise this curriculum to better suit the mentors and mentees who use it and reflect our goals. At the Northwestern Chapter level, school coordinators and mentors implement curriculum at our chapter’s partner schools. We attend weekly mentoring sessions and get to work and connect with the mentees.</p>

            <p>Supplies for Dreams believes that every student should have the opportunity to go on a field trip during their K-8 education. The Award-a-Field Trip (AAFT) committee works to provide students with an engaging learning experience at a number of sites in Chicago, extending learning beyond classrooms in an exciting and exploratory way. The field trip team coordinates and leads 4th-8th grade students on field trips throughout the school year. Currently, students are able to visit the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field Museum, the Adler Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium, the Chicago History Museum, and the Northwestern Campus.</p>
